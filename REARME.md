### Hi everyone! 

I have a long story, but I'll try to tell it short. 

I graduate **[Steam and gas turbines department](https://mpei.ru/lang/en/structure/Power_Machinery_and_Mechanics/sgt/Pages/default.aspx) of [Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI)](https://mpei.ru/lang/en/Pages/default.aspx)** with excellent and now i have Bachelor's and **Master's degrees** with this specialty. During studying in MPEI I had an internship to **[Friedrich-Alexander university in Nurnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu/)**, exactly in **[technical thermodynamics department (LTT)](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/)** (thanks a lot to *[Prof. Riedle](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/person/klaus-riedle/) **[foundation](https://mpei.ru/internationalactivities/international_programs_for_students_MPEI/Pages/Ridle.aspx)***). I worked in **[combustion technology group](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/verbrennungstechnik/)** under the guidance of *[Lars Zigan](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/person/lars-zigan/)* (you can contact him to get a feedback).

My group researched of **dual-component fuel combustion process**. I did a **short code in MatLab that determinate a brightness of combustion in every frame from highspeed camera (8-bit frames)**. That was my first time of applied programming. 

After internship, I went back to Moscow for graduate exams. Graduated MPEI and started work by Product design engineer on different factories. **Last 3 years I developed [turboexpanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboexpander)** (all you will see on this [page](http://detander.overhaul-pro.ru/) *is my developments from idea and sketch up to assembling and work test. Also, I did **two patent applications***).

My work and short part of life in Germany reformed my views. **I want to keep up with the times**.  When I had the opportunity, I started **DataScience** course. Now trying to change the work field.

Here i will share my code and ideas. I open for suggestions.
