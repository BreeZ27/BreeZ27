### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduate **[Steam and gas turbines department](https://mpei.ru/lang/en/structure/Power_Machinery_and_Mechanics/sgt/Pages/default.aspx) of [Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI)](https://mpei.ru/lang/en/Pages/default.aspx)**. During studying in MPEI I had an internship to **[Friedrich-Alexander university in Nurnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu/)**, exactly in **[technical thermodynamics department (LTT)](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/)** (thanks a lot to *[Prof. Riedle](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/person/klaus-riedle/) **[foundation](https://mpei.ru/internationalactivities/international_programs_for_students_MPEI/Pages/Ridle.aspx)***). I worked in **[combustion technology group](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/verbrennungstechnik/)** under the guidance of *[Lars Zigan](https://www.ltt.tf.fau.de/person/lars-zigan/)*. My group researched of **dual-component fuel combustion process**. There **I got my first experience of applied industrial development**, when I was writing code in MatLab that determinate a brightness of combustion in every frame from high-speed camera (8-bit frames)**.
